Sometimes life calls for a bit of randomness.

Whether or not its grabbing a marble from a bag, a card from a deck or
something else entirely this library will give you a simple yet powerful
addition to Foundation objects functionality, random behavior.

DWRandom is a lightweight framework written in Objective-C that makes working
with randomization in many of the Foundation core objects a breeze. The
interface is extension based and aims to be dead simple to use and
effortless to learn. Use DWRandom if you want to add a deadly one liner for
randomization in your project.

### Features
------------

So why use this library and not write your own randomization utility methods?
While you're welcome to do so, theres several reasons you might want to use 
DWRandom in your project.

* Dead simple developer inteface, and a lot of nice one-liners
* 100% documentation coverage
* Comprehensive testing on all methods
* Cocoapods integration, get started fast
* Completely extension based, no need for additional classes
* Properly implemented, see [implementation](#implementation) for more info

### Installation
----------------

###### Cocoapods

DWRandom is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```
pod "DWRandom"
```

Now you can add to your project with

```objc
#import <DWRandom/DWRandom.h>
```

###### Source

You can clone the repo with git:

```
git clone https://github.com/dmwesterhoff/DWRandom.git
```

then simply add the files to your project, and use a local import header

```objc
#import "DWRandom.h"
```

### Usage
---------

To make things easy to remember all methods in the DWRandom library are 
prefixed with the word 'random'. For example choosing a random element from
an array.

```objc
id randomObject = [array randomObject];
```

or grabbing a random UIColor...

```objc
UIColor *randomColor = [UIColor randomColor];
```

Easy to remember right? Heres a comprehensive list of all available methods,

### Documentation
-----------------

You can check out the full reference documentation 
[here](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/DWRandom/).

### Implementation
------------------

Underlying the library is the `arc4random()` function, more specifically the 
`arc4random_uniform()` as it avoids a modulo bias as opposed to doing something
like `arc4random() % n`. arc4random methods also have significantly better
range than other "equivalents".

The arc4random man pages say:

```
The arc4random() function uses the key stream generator employed by the
arc4 cipher, which uses 8*8 8 bit S-Boxes.  The S-Boxes can be in about
(2**1700) states.  The arc4random() function returns pseudo-random numbers
in the range of 0 to (2**32)-1, and therefore has twice the range of
rand(3) and random(3).
```

And some information on the modulo bias from the man pages:

```
arc4random_uniform() will return a uniformly distributed random number
less than upper_bound.  arc4random_uniform() is recommended over construc-
tions like ``arc4random() % upper_bound'' as it avoids "modulo bias" when
the upper bound is not a power of two.
```

Another benefit of using the arc4random function famility is that none
of the functions need be explicitly seeded as it is done automatically
behind the scenes.
