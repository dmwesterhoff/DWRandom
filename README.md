Sometimes life calls for a bit of randomness.

Whether or not its grabbing a marble from a bag, a card from a deck or
something else entirely this library will give you a simple yet powerful
addition to Foundation objects functionality, random behavior.

DWRandom is a lightweight framework written in Objective-C that makes working
with randomization in many of the Foundation core objects a breeze. The
interface is extension based and aims to be dead simple to use and
effortless to learn. Use DWRandom if you want to add a deadly one liner for
randomization in your project.
